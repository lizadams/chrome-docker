# VERDI_2.1 Docker
A Docker image that can run Google Chrome and VERDI_2.1

Both Chrome and VERDI require an X11 Display.

This code was forked from https://github.com/stephen-fox/chrome-docker

## How does it work?
The Docker image includes a VNC server which provides graphical access to the
virtual display running in the container.

## How do I build it? - Note it is available in Dockerhub, see below.
Refer to the [building documentation](docs/building).

```
git pull https://github.com/lizadams/chrome-docker.git
cd image
docker build -t lizadams/verdi_2.1 .
```

## How did I push it to docker hub
Created a docker hub repository lizadams/verdi_2.1 on https://hub.docker.com/
Linked to my github account
After building the above image locally, I then pushed it to the docker hub.

```
docker push lizadams/verdi_2.1
```

## How do I obtain the container from dockerhub

```
docker pull lizadams/verdi_2.1
```

## How do I run the container?
First, start the container and its VNC server:
```
docker run -p 5900:5900 --name chrome --user apps --privileged <image-name>
```

## How do I connect to the container?
First, download a VNC Server such as Chicken of the VNC.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/
You may need to save the dmg, then use finder to open it, and give permission to install.

Open Chicken of the Sea VNC.
Click on Connection > New Connection
The default is to connect to localhost

Click on connect.
You will see a new window with the flux icon.

Right Click on the new fluxbox window
Select Applications > Shells > Bash

Using the bash terminal change directories to the VERDI_2.1 then run the verdi.sh script

```
cd VERDI_2.1
./verdi.sh
```

On the Dataset Panel, click on the yellow + icon and select a file from the VERDI_2.1/data/model directory.
Select CCTM46_P16.baseO2a.36k.O3MAX
Then Click Open
On the Variables list double click on O3 to add the Ozone Variable as the Selected Formula.
Then click on Tile Plot

The following plot image will be displayed.

You can interactively change the timestep or the layer number by using the radio buttons on the Tile Plot.

Now that we have VERDI_2.1 running within a container, the next question is how to mount another drive to access data that was generated by the CMAQ Container.


**Note**: The macOS VNC client will not be able to login unless you set a
password for the VNC server. The instructions for setting a VNC password can be
found below.

By default, the VNC server is started without a password. If you would like to
specify a password for the VNC server, do the following:
```
docker run -p 5900:5900 -e VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD=some-password --name chrome \
    --user apps --privileged <image-name>
```

Once the container is running, you can VNC into it at `127.0.0.1` and run Chrome
from a terminal window by running:
```
google-chrome
```

You can also start Google Chrome by right-clicking the Desktop and selecting:
```
Applications > Network > Web Browsing > Google Chrome
```

## Additional settings
Refer to the [configuration documentation](docs/configuration).

## Security concerns
This image starts a X11 VNC server which spawns a framebuffer. Google Chrome
also requires that the image be run with the `--privileged` flag set. This flag
disables security labeling for the resulting container. Be very careful if you
run the container on a non-firewalled host.

Some applications (such as Google Chrome) will not run under the root user. A
non-root user named `apps` is included for such scenarios.
